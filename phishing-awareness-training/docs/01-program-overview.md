# Phishing Awareness Training — Program Overview

## 1. Program Purpose

The purpose of this program is to assess and improve user resistance to phishing attacks while validating the effectiveness of endpoint security controls and SOC visibility.

This program treats phishing primarily as a **human-layer risk**, not a technical failure.

The focus is on:

* Measuring user behavior
* Confirming prevention controls
* Using SOC telemetry to validate outcomes
* Delivering targeted awareness improvements

---

## 2. Business Context

Phishing remains one of the most common initial access vectors in real-world security incidents.
Even in environments with strong technical controls, user interaction can still initiate risk.

This program simulates a realistic phishing scenario to:

* Identify awareness gaps
* Verify that defenses activate before impact
* Ensure SOC teams can reconstruct events accurately

---

## 3. Program Scope

### In Scope

* Simulated phishing email (link-based)
* One test user
* Endpoint telemetry (browser + OS)
* SIEM-based investigation
* Awareness outcome classification

### Out of Scope

* Real malware execution
* Credential harvesting
* Data exfiltration
* Lateral movement
* Punitive user actions

This program is **training-focused**, not adversarial.

## 4. Training Philosophy

This program follows three core principles:

1. **Evidence over assumptions**
   All conclusions are based on endpoint and SIEM telemetry.

2. **No-blame culture**
   User mistakes are treated as learning opportunities.

3. **Defense validation**
   A “blocked” attack is still valuable if lessons are extracted.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

### User

* Receives phishing simulation
* Interacts naturally
* Receives feedback after assessment

### SOC Analyst

* Monitors telemetry
* Reconstructs timeline
* Classifies outcome
* Documents findings

### Security Program Owner

* Reviews metrics
* Approves training conclusions
* Plans follow-up actions

---

## 6. Success Criteria

The program is considered successful if:

* User behavior is accurately measured
* Endpoint protections are validated
* SOC visibility is confirmed
* A clear awareness outcome is documented

Success does **not** require malware execution or system compromise.

---

## 7. Deliverables

* Program documentation
* Evidence-backed investigation
* Awareness outcome classification
* Lessons learned for future training iterations

---

## 8. Program Status

**Status:** Completed
**Result:** Awareness gap identified, controls effective, no impact
